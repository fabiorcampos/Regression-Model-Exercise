## Executive Summary

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Data Processing

The variables present in the dataset are:

    mpg - Miles/(US) gallon
    cyl - Number of cylinders
    disp - Displacement (cu.in.)
    hp - Gross horsepower
    drat - Rear axle ratio
    wt - Weight (lb/1000)
    qsec - 1/4 mile time
    vs - V/S
    am - Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
    gear - Number of forward gears
    carb - Number of carburators

1. A briefly analysis of variables
```{r}
library(car) 
mtcars$am = as.factor(mtcars$am)
levels(mtcars$am) = c("Automatic", "Manual")
summary(mtcars$mpg); summary(mtcars$am)
```

## Exploratory analysis

2. A Scatterplot to check the relations of MPG variables and some variables separating by type of transmission
```{r}
scatterplotMatrix(~mpg+disp+drat+wt+hp|am, data=mtcars,
                   col = c("blue", "red"),
                   main="Type of Transmission")
```

3. Boxplot to check what the type of transmission could be more efficiently to gas consumption. 
```{r}
autmanbox = boxplot(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars, main = "Comparison of MPG by type of Transmission",
              xlab = "Type of Gear",
              ylab = "Car consumption (MPG)",
              ylim = c(10, 35),
              col = c("blue", "red"))
```

4. A correlation analysis of MPG variable and others. 

```{r}
cor(mtcars[, -c(9)])[1, ]
```

5. A decision to analyse the relation of Weight variable. 

```{r}
wtplot = scatterplot(mpg ~ wt | am, data=mtcars,
                     xlab="Weight of Car", ylab="Car Consumption (MPG)",
                     main="Car Weight and Consumption by Type of Transmission",
                     col = c("blue", "red"),
                     legend.title = "Type of Transmission",
                     legend.coords = "topright") 
```

## Linear models

6.1 Fit 1 
```{r}
fit1 = lm(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars)
```

6.2 Fit 2
```{r}
fit2 = lm(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars)
```

6.3 Fit 3
```{r}
fit3 = lm(mpg ~ am + wt, data=mtcars)
```

## Models comparisiton

```{r}
par(mfcol = c(1, 3))
plot(mtcars$wt, resid(fit1), main = "Model 1", xlab = "Weight (lbs/1000)", ylab = "Residuals")
plot(mtcars$wt, resid(fit2), main = "Model 2", xlab = "Weight (lbs/1000)", ylab = "Residuals")
plot(mtcars$wt, resid(fit3), main = "Model 3", xlab = "Weight (lbs/1000)", ylab = "Residuals")
```
